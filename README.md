## Component Hierarchy

Root containers:

Each thought consists of many layers of components that provide various functionalities. This is necessary from a performance perspective to avoid re-rendering all thought components when a small slice changes, when a thought falls outside the viewport and can be virtualized.

```
└─Content
  └─LayoutTree
    └─LayoutShim
      └─VirtualThought
        └─ThoughtContainer
          ├─Bullet
          ├─ThoughtAnnotation
          │ └─Superscript
          └─StaticThought
            └─Editable
```

- `<Content>` - a root container that defines the margins of the thoughtspace and handles clicking on empty space.
- `<LayoutTree>` - a root container that defines the margins of the thoughtspace and handles clicking on empty space.

- `<VirtualThought>` - Conditionally renders a shim when the thought is hidden by autofocus. The shim is a simple div with a height attribute matching the thought's height.
- `<ThoughtContainer>` - Contains the Bullet, ThoughtAnnotation, and StaticThought for a single thought.
- `<Bullet>` - This is, unsurprisingly, the bullet of the thought.
- `<ThoughtAnnotation>` - A non-interactive, hidden clone of StaticThought that is used to position the Superscript.
- `<StaticThought>` - Contains the Editable and Superscript.
- `<Editable>` - Renders the thought text as a content-editable and handles live editing, throttled updates, selection, pasting, and all other editing capacities.
